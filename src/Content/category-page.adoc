=== Category Page

The category page was automatically created by fetching all category information from SFCC and populating the page information that will be discussed below.




==== Slots

The slots on the Category (PLP) page are localized so that content can be unique across the defined locales (see below). If a localized slot is empty there is no fallback content available and no content will be displayed for that locale.
